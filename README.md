Datasets
--------
The following raw data files were used in developing this repo and are available for you to download from [this folder](https://umich.box.com/v/scint-psd-repo-datar). These datasets were collected throughout the research that led to the following papers: [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7465791/), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900216311342?via%3Dihub), [3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353858/). The files retain their original filenames as recorded in the data collection.
